[1217]â†’	Unit 6.13: Project 12: Building the OS
OS is just an abstraction specified by the API
if we are a software developer learning to code, we are satisfied
however, we're part of Nand2Tetris and we will implement the OS!
VME has a built-in OS implementation in Java
nand2tetris/tools/os has another OS implementation in Jack, but it's been translated to VM to avoid giving away the solution
reverse engineering: you want to implement existing OS
	has lots of executable models and rely on each other (you have source code)
	to implement you should test each file on its own inside the other models and run them separately
how to test OS screen class?
	get the stub file: skeleton of all the non-API subroutines
	just review relevant material to implement
	given: stub file, test file. goal: implement functions in stub file, past test
	repeat for other classes
develop in any order!
final test: Pong! make copy, copy compiled VM files, execute directory
